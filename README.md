## Section 4

### Predicting Trend Using Classification

**The folder contains the following topics:**

**Import SVM module:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=46&section_no=4&unit_no=6) where you will learn how to write the first few lines of the code to import the machine learning libraries.

**Import Data:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=46&section_no=4&unit_no=7) where you will learn to import data which will be used for training and testing the model.

**Support Vector Classifier Strategy:**
An [Ipython notebook](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=46&section_no=4&unit_no=8) to learn how to use the support vector classifier (SVC) algorithm and its implementation on S&P500.
